INFINITE FUSION 5.0

IMPORTANT: 
If you already have a pre-5.0 savefile, it needs to be moved to the appdata folder.
You can do this automatically by running "migrate_savefile.bat" which is included in this download (you might need to run it as administrator)
If this doesn't work, you can copy the savefile manually.

	pre-5.0 savefile location: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Pokémon Infinite Fusion\Game.rxdata
	5.0+ savefile location: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\infinitefusion\Game.rxdata

You can add custom sprites to the game in the Graphics/CustomBattlers folder.

If you want to have multiple savefiles, just rename this file to something else and start a new game.
